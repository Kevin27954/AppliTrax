# AppliTrax


## Project Purpose:

Job Hunters constantly apply to many job applications while also maintaining their current lifestyle, such as their study, health, or even their current job. This often leads to a messy history of random emails, loss or missed opportunities, or even potential loss of opportunities as they lose focus on their job hunt. The goal of this project is to create a central hub of information that job hunters can use to be on top of their job hunt.

## Within the Application You Will be Able to:
 - Keep Records of you Applications
 - View the current Trending Applications
 - See Statistics of Your Current Job Hunting Period
 - Store Important Job Boards Links
 - News Articles / Links to Trust Worthy Daily News

Once you logged in to the application with your account, you will be greeted by the overview page. It contains a quick summary of your application progress along with reminders to change old applications that you might have forgotten.
